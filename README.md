Building Robust Software Summative Assignment

By the end of this course, you will build an installable Python package that analyzes data retrieved from the GitHub API (or another web data provider of your choice). You'll work in teams and collaborate using tools on GitHub.
Requirements

The deliverable, your package:

    Must be hosted on a GitHub repository.
    Must be installable using pip: pip install git+https://github.com/user/yourteamrepo
    Must include a module named Analysis
    Must include a README.md, LICENSE, and CONDUCT.md file
    Must include unit tests, as appropriate
    Must include a TESTS.md file detailing in point-form the non-automated tests to be performed, as appropriate
    Must use the logging library to output debug, info, and error messages as appropriate
    Must be documented using Python docstrings in the numpy style
    Must use try/except to handle errors, must raise useful error messages, and must include at least one assertion
        Hint: We can't analyze data that has not yet been loaded! And consider incorrect configuration parameters!

During development, your team must:

    Track features using GitHub issues
        Each constituent function of the Analysis module should be one or more issues
        Each issue should be assigned to a member of your team
        Your team should distribute workload evenly
    Make changes to the repository by forking the main repository, updating your fork, and merging your changes using pull requests
